# Portfolio Project

This project showcases my expertise in **Python**, **SQL**, **dbt**, and various **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** tools such as **Google Cloud Functions**, **BigQuery**, **Cloud Scheduler**, and more. Additionally, it highlights my proficiency in **Terraform** and **GitHub Actions** for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD).

## Key Technologies and Tools:
- **Python**: Backend scripting and automation
- **SQL**: Data manipulation and querying
- **dbt**: Data transformation and modeling
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**:
  - **Google Cloud Functions**: Serverless computing
  - **BigQuery**: Data warehousing and analytics
  - **Cloud Scheduler**: Job scheduling and automation
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code for managing GCP resources
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline automation

This repository contains the code, configurations, and deployment scripts used to build and manage the project, demonstrating practical use cases of data engineering and cloud computing.
